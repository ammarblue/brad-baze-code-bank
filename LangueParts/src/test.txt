Scientists have known about antimatter for more than 80 years, after physicist Carl Anderson discovered positrons in the 1930s.
CERN makes the antimatter for ALPHA's experiment using a particle accelerator, which speeds up subatomic particles to nearly the speed of light and crashes them into each other to produce new particles.
In the world of Dan Brown's "Angels and Demons" and Gene Roddenberry's "Star Trek," antimatter can make the Vatican explode or power a star ship.
If a large chunk of antimatter were to touch a large chunk of matter, the explosion would indeed be enormous, but it's unlikely to happen. Antimatter has not existed naturally in the universe for a very long time.
"Not in the last 13.7 billion years," Hangst jokes. That's basically as long as the known universe has existed.
